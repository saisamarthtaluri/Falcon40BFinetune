Reducing sugar intake and incorporating regular physical activity can help control blood sugar levels. If the tests confirm diabetes, we can create a personalized plan to manage your condition effectively.\n",

We'll take it one step at a time and work together to create a plan that fits your lifestyle and preferences. Remember, you're not alone in this; I'll be here to support you every step of the way.\n",
